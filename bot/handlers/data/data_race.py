            "Dwarves are sturdy warriors, miners, stoneworkers, and smiths. Though just under 5 feet tall, theyâ€™re dense and broad, weighing as much as much taller people. Their skin is earthy brown, sometimes reddish; hair is usually dark or brown and worn long, with pale dwarves sometimes having red hair. Male dwarves highly value their beards.\n\n"
            "Dwarves can live over 400 years, giving them a unique outlook and strong traditions. They are loyal, determined, and slow to forgive, with wrongs against one often becoming clan disputes.\n\n"
            "Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep under mountains, where they mine gems and gold. The clan is central to their society, and losing clan ties is the greatest shame. Many dwarves abroad work as skilled smiths, jewelers, or respected mercenaries.\n\n"
            "Dwarves adventure for treasure, divine guidance, or to restore clan honor. Their devotion to hard work, tradition, and ancestors motivates them throughout their long lives."

Their pride is matched only by their discipline, and they are known to stand firm against any foe or hardship.\n\nMost excel as master smiths, warriors, or protectors, pursuing excellence in craft and combat. Many set out as adventurers to prove their mettle, reclaim lost relics, or achieve legendary feats, carrying the unbreakable spirit and ancient pride of their mountain homes into the wider world."

They often find events amusing, driven more by curiosity than greed. Slow to make friends or enemies and even slower to forgive, they respond to minor slights with disdain and serious offenses with vengeance. Flexible like young branches, they prefer diplomacy but fiercely defend their homes with sword, bow, and strategy.\n\nMost live in small forest villages, hunting, gathering, and crafting without harming nature. Some trade metals they donâ€™t mine. Traveling elves become bards, artists, or sages. Passionate about travel, they study, explore, and master magic and combat, preferring a slower pace than humans and sometimes joining rebels or moral causes."

They are patient and slow to trust, yet fiercely protective when threatened. Offenses are met with restraint, but grave wrongs spark decisive action. Agile and adaptable like the trees themselves, wood elves prefer diplomacy and camouflage but defend their realms with keen archery and woodland cunning.\n\nMost wood elves hunt, gather, and craft without harming their forests. Skilled in stealth and the arts of survival, some become scouts or guides beyond their lands, valued by those seeking their wisdom and mastery of the wild."

Drow treasure secrecy, ambition, cunning, and the beauty found in darkness and shadow.\n\nWith lifespans over 700 years, drow develop a keen awareness of intrigue and ever-shifting alliances. They're cautious and slow to trust, but respond decisively to betrayal. Minor slights are ignored; true insults spark long-lasting revenge. Flexible and elusive, drow rely on diplomacy or subterfuge, but defend their domains with formidable sorcery and precise tactics.\n\nMost drow master magic and stealth, thriving as spies, assassins, or nobles in a rigid society. Someâ€”driven by curiosity or a desire for redemptionâ€”venture beyond the Underdark, becoming adventurers, outcasts, or enigmatic allies valued for their skills and rare insight."
